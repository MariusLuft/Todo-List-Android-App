# Todo-List-Android-App
A simple and clean todo-app for Android. The goal is to have the app let you add todo-tasks, strike them through when they're completed and also to delete all completed tasks. It therefore copies the idea of the popular and widely used tasks app by Google. As an orientation a video course by Philipp Lackner was used.

## How to get started

The final app can be installed in the blink of an eye by downloading the apk-file from my google drive and opening it on your android phone.

##  Technology and Concepts

Kotlin was choosen rather than Java because it is heavily promoted by Google and might therefore gain more and more importance in the future as a trending programming language. The app is composed of a main activity that contains a few standard views added with the android studio designer palette.

In order to save the todos and to still see them after reopening the app I decided to use SQL Lite as a database. SQL Lite is widely used and offers a simple way of storing data without connecting to external servers. Instead it stores everything on local disc files.
